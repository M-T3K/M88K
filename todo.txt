TODO LIST
==========================================================

- @Feature: Automatic Selection (If nothing is selected then the 
  extension should automatically select up to the previous whitespace char).

  as well as specified numbers.)

**********************************************************
                      Next Update
**********************************************************     

- @Feature: There is a setting for the Default Endianness that should be used.
- @Improv: (For Internal usage) RemoveWhitespace Function.
- @Feature: Add Setting for Endianness Mode (So that it stays 
  consistent with what the user wants, specified in settings.json)
- @Feature: autoclose and autosurround works with most types of braces.
- @Feature: Comment keybindings now work for m88k files.
- @Bug: Number Conversion not working with Negative numbers. 
  :Update
  ** Negative Decimal to Hexadecimal now works. However, it is very difficult 
  to convert Negative Hexadecimal back to Decimal. Reason being is that it 
  can't be done consistently (it is very difficult to know the MSB) as far 
  as I am aware unless you put a - sign in front.
  ** Negative Hexadecimal to Decimal is working. You need to implicitly add a '-'
  in front of the number.
- @Test: Add Unit Tests (Unit tests work great for small things like this).
- @Improv: Change Language Name from m88k assembly to M88K.
- @Improv: Make it so that the activation event is also 'onLanguage::m88K'.
- @Feature: Endianness Mode at the Global Scope.
