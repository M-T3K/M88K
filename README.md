# m88k README

This is the README for your extension "m88k". After writing up a brief description, we recommend including the following sections.

## Features

This is an attempt to create a fully fledged IDE for the assembly language used by Motorola 88K family of Microprocessor. Currently it only offers 2 functions:

- **endianTransform**: Changes the endian mode of a hex number.
- **addHex**: Adds '0x' at the beginning of a string.

There are other features planned, such as an emulator for this architecture.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `extension.m88k.textTools`: command that opens a QuickPick menu to perform several of the functions.

## Known Issues

None yet.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1 - 06/12/18

Initial release of M88K. Only **endianTransform** and **addHex** are available.
